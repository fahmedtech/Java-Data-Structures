<h3>Class MyLoan -- in "MyLoan.java"</h3>
The class MyLoan should have the following members:
<blockquote>
	<b>Private instance variables:</b> 	<ul>
		<li>double amountBorrowed -- the principal amount of the loan.		 
		</li>
		<li>double yearlyRate -- the annual interest rate of the loan. A rate of 
		7.25% for example must be stored as 7.25.		 </li>
		<li>int years -- the number of years on the loan.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Constructor</b>
	<ul>
		<li>public MyLoan( ) -- Initializes all instance variables to 0</li>
		<li>public MyLoan( double amt, double rt, int yrs) -- Initialize the 
		instance variables using the parameters.</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Public instance methods</b>
	<ul>
		<li>public double getAmountBorrowed()		 </li>
		<li>public double getYearlyRate()		 </li>
		<li>public int getYears()		 </li>
		<li>public double monthlyPayment() -- This method should return the 
		monthly payment. Use the following formula to compute this amount. </li>
		<p><img height="33" src="./HW3_files/clip_image002.png" width="118"></p>where
		<strong>A</strong> is the amount of monthly payment, <b>P </b>is the amount borrowed, <b>i </b>is the <i>
		monthly rate</i> (= <b><font color="#ff0000">(yearlyRate / 100) / 12</font></b>) 
		and <b>n </b>is the <i>number of payments</i> (= <b>
		<font color="#ff0000">years * 12</font></b>).&nbsp;
		For example a person borrowing $100000 at a rate of 6.25% for 30 years 
		should have a monthly payment which is around $615.) 
		<li>public double totalPayment() -- This method should return the total 
		amount paid to the bank (= the monthly payment * the <i>number of 
		payments</i>).    	 </li>
		<li>public String toString() -- This method will return as a String the 
		instance variables in the following form (<b>including the $ symbol/char 
		and exactly two decimal digits</b>). 
		Using the above example:      	 
	<div align="left">
		<pre align="left">   Loan: $100,000.00 at 6.25% for 30 years</pre>
	</div>
	<div align="left">
		<p>To obtain a String with two decimal digits (similar to how we did using 
		printf)… the way is to use a static method defined in Java String class 
		called “format” (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html</a>) 
		and pass in a format string “%.2f” and the (instance) variable which you 
		want to be printed (in a string) with two decimal digits. So for 
		example, </p>
		<p>String temp1 = <b>String.format(“$%.2f”, </b>amountBorrowed); // 
		temp1 is "$2.48" if amountBorrrowed is 2.48 </p>
		<p>Then you can concatenate several strings or other values to make one long 
		string by using a + operator. For example,</p><pre>  String sj = "Java";
int val = 7;
  String ret = "This is " + sj + " " + val; // "This is Java 7"</pre>
		</div></li>
	</ul>

<h3>Client Program as a Unit Test (in main()<span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Write code in main() which does the following.&nbsp; It's 
	mean to be an client/application program, but placed in main() for now to 
	simplify the scheme, just for&nbsp; the purpose of mechanics.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">This application simulates a Loan specialist. The specialist 
	has two pre-set interest rates: one for 15 years and another for 30 years. 
	They should be declared as constants RATE15 (= <b><font color="#FF00FF">5.75</font></b>) and RATE30 
	(= <font color="#FF00FF">6.25</font>) in the application. 
	The application/specialist asks the user/customer for the principal amount 
	to borrow, and displays the monthly payment and the total payment for both 
	15 and 30 years (i.e., what-if scenarios).&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Below is the sample output of a session. The part where the user entered 
	is indicated in bold.</p>

	<li><u>REQUIREMENTS:</u> 	
	<ol>
		<li>Create <b>two MyLoan objects</b> -- one for the 15 year loan, and 
		another for the 30 year loan, in every session.</li>
		<li>Print the first line of the analysis for each Loan by <b>calling the 
		toString() method</b>. </li>
		<li>The monthly and total payments must be obtained by <b>calling the 
		monthlyPayment() and totalPayment() methods</b> respectively (and in no 
		other way).&nbsp; And those values must be printed with <strong>two 
		decimal digits</strong> (and followed by a $).</li>
		<li>Repeat the session as long as the user wants.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="style2">Receive input from the keyboard, and display the output to the terminal&nbsp; Also 
you can assume the user will enter valid values at the prompts.</p>
