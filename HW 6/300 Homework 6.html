Homework #6<br>
Due: Mar 12 (Thu) 11:59 pm</h3>
      <p>
	This assignment is an application using a stack. You will use the <strong>Java API</strong> has 
	  a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html">
	  generic <strong>Stack class</strong></a> (in java.util.Stack).
      </p>
<ul>
	<li>Write a class <strong>BalancedApp</strong> with a static main method that will parse an
input file to check that it has properly balanced curly braces,
square brackets, and parentheses - '{', '}', '[', ']', '(', and
	')'. These characters will be referred to as <i>delimiters</i>.
</li>
	<li>What does <i>properly balanced</i> mean? It means when
	examining the characters of the file when the <i>closing</i> delimiter
	']', is encountered, the most recently seen <i>unmatched opening</i>
      delimiter should be the matching one, '[' and similarly for the
	other delimiters. (See examples below.)</li>
	<li>Your program should read data from an <strong>input file</strong>, and 
displays the output to the terminal.&nbsp; <br>There are four short sample input files 
(<a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/ntomuro/courses/300/assign/hw6files/test1.txt">"test1.txt</a>", 
	<a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/ntomuro/courses/300/assign/hw6files/test2.txt">"test2.txt"</a>, 
	<a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/ntomuro/courses/300/assign/hw6files/test3.txt">"test3.txt"</a>, 
	<a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/ntomuro/courses/300/assign/hw6files/test4.txt">"test4.txt"</a>), which are zipped in

zip file </a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details of the program</h3>
<p>Your program (which you write in main() and any additional static method(s) 
you create as you wish) reads in one line at a time from the input file, and 
process the characters in the line.&nbsp; You continue until all lines in the 
input file are read and processed.</p>
<p>As each line is read, your program must also prints the line to the terminal 
with a <strong>line number</strong> (1-based).&nbsp; Then after all lines are 
(processed and) printed, you display the verdict -- the input is balanced, or 
any error is detected.</p>
For example, the file test1.txt contains:
<pre class="plain">This file has balanced curly braces, square brackets
and parentheses: {}, [] and (). [Note that these
characters are not required to balance on the
same line, as long as there is a matching closing character.]
</pre>
      <p>
	  Your output should be:</p>
<pre class="plain">   1. This file has balanced curly braces, square brackets
  2. and parentheses: {}, [] and (). [Note that these
  3. characters are not required to balance on the
  4. same line, as long as there is a matching closing character.]

Input is balanced.</pre>

<p>
because the delimiters in the file are balanced.&nbsp; But some files may be 
unbalanced.. there are three error cases as shown below.&nbsp; For each error 
case, you must print detailed error information, in particular the line number 
where the (un-)matching opening delimiter was.
</p>
<ol>
<li> An additional closing character - '}', ']', or ')' - when the preceding text
is balanced, ad there is an extra closing character (of any kind).
<pre class="plain">File test2.txt:
[This ({line} is balanced) ],
but this character ] is not.
--------------------------------

Output:

  1. [This ({line} is balanced) ],
  2. but this character ]

Error: Line 2. Closing character ']', with no matching opening character.</pre>

<p><i>The line numbers for the output and the reference to the Line number
in the Error message are also required. See Implementation
Hints below.</i></p>
</li>
<li> A closing character which does not match the most recent
unmatched opening character.
<pre class="plain">File test3.txt:
(This left parenthesis
is not "closed"! [Balanced
square brackets], then a } 
at the end.
-----------------------------
Output:

  1. (This left parenthesis
  2. is not "closed"! [Balanced
  3. square brackets], then a }
Error: Line 3. Symbol '}' is the wrong closing symbol  for char = '(', line 1</pre>
</li>
<li> End of file reached but with an opening character still not
matched.
<pre class="plain">File test4.txt:
Opening square
bracket, [, is not matched
when end of file reached.
--------------------------
Output:

  1. Opening square
  2. bracket, [, is not matched
  3. when end of file reached.

Error: At end of file, no closing symbol found for char = '[', line 2</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The error message has to be as SPECIFIC as possible, at least the level 
above, including the line number where the error was encountered and the 
unmatched left delimiter character.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Implementation Hints</h3>

To read from an input file, there are several things to set up in the code.&nbsp; 
You also read one line at a time from the file foe this program.&nbsp; To do so,
 you can use a Scanner object and connect it to the file (through a FileReader 
object), and call next Line() to read in the next/one line.&nbsp; Your program 
can start like this.<pre class="style6"><span class="style7">import java.util.Stack;</span>
import java.util.Scanner;// (*)
import java.io.*;        // (*)

public class BalancedApp
{
  public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException // (*)
  {
    Stack&lt;DelimPos&gt; st = new Stack&lt;DelimPos&gt;(); // a stack of DelimPos objects

    Scanner fin = new Scanner(new FileReader("test1.txt")); // (*)
    String s;
    while (fin.hasNext()) // read until there's more to read,
    {
      s = fin.nextLine(); // read the next line

</pre>
<p>
Then for each line read (into a String), you traverse the string and examine 
each character.&nbsp; To do so, you can call the string methods length() and 
charAt().&nbsp; For example,</p>
<pre class="style6"><span class="style7">      for (int i = 0; i &lt; s.length(); ++i) {</span>
        char ch = s.charAt(i);
        ...
     }</pre>
<hr>
<h3>
Algorithm</h3>
<p>
Use a stack to keep track of the opening symbols - '{', '[',
'('. You will need to also keep track of line number where these
	  symbols appeared. So it will be a good idea to create a class
	  to represent the information you will need to push onto the
	  stack when an <i>opening</i> symbol is read. For now I'll call this
	  class <span class="style9">DelimPos</span>.&nbsp; YOU HAVE TO WRITE THIS 
CLASS (in addition to the application class <strong>BalancedApp.</strong></p>

<pre class="plain">Stack&lt;DelimPos&gt; s = new Stack&lt;DelimPos&gt;();

s.push(new DelimPos(...));   
</pre>
<p> To print line numbers and also have the error message
reference a previous line number where an opening symbol occurred,
the DelimPos instances will minimally need to 
contain both the opening delimiter character and the line number
where it occurred. It might also be useful for the DelimPos class to
	  have a method to provide the matching closing character for 
	  DelimPos instances.</p>
